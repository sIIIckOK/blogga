title

the first line is used as the title.
if you want to use the name of the file as the title leave the first line blank and start from a new line.
the first line is not rendered btw, only used for the title.

# Header this is h1
## Header this is h2

this is normal paragraph
@nl
use the @nl for new lines
use @img <path> for images, makes sure if they are relative, to be relative to the .page file
attributes with @... should be written in new lines

if u want to change the style change the style.css as that is the only global style

btw, dont edit anything inside the `output` folder cuz that is generated and wont stay on every iteration
